toDo
- verify that log structure is the same with the tic tac toe project
- implement castling
- implement en passant
* implement undo,
  currently have bug when updating captured pieces, i think problem is when many of the same type of pieces are captured it is reduced to just 1 piece in the capturedPieces component.



bugs:
- the covers are not updated in a timely manner
  - inconsistent results when the path for castling is blocked (i.e. there is some enemy piece intercepting) 


* - currently in progress
